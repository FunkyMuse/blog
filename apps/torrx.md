Disclaimer:
TorrX is a meta-search engine (aggregator) and a Multisearch.

This means it just search other search engines.

TorrX is a very powerful internet location search tool.

TorrX is not a torrent cache, torrent tracker nor a torrent directory, you cannot upload anything here.

TorrX does not host or "make available" any files or torrents in any way, shape or form.

TorrX links to other independent search engines that might host torrent files. We have absolutely no control over those domains and we don't have any actual knowledge of their content at all.

Torrent files are simply metadata and cannot be copyrighted.

We don't host torrents, we don't even save torrents for ourselves after the filename and size extraction.

Torrx Torrent Search Engine is the best tool to search and find torrents directly from your device!

This is only a torrent search application which acts as a torrent magnet search engine, you will require a torrent client to download torrent files.

Note : This app doesn't store or log any search query/results. all the data are collected/queried using public APIs.
